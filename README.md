# Data-Management
A tutorial on data-management basics using OpenRefine. Adapted from a 2017 Data Managment workshop designed by Rachael Starry and the [tri-cods tidy-data workshop](https://github.com/tri-cods/tidy-data).

As scholars seeking to use digital methods in our research, we need to understand how we can make both quantitative and qualitative data machine-readable and machine-usable. But what is data anyway? What is a dataset? Where can we find raw data? How do we know whether our data is "clean" or "dirty"? How can we clean "dirty" data? These are a few of the questions which this workshop sets out to address.  

## Learning Goals
- Understand the structure and appearance of datasets
- Discover where and how to find data online
- Apply learned concepts in order to clean raw datasets in OpenRefine
