# Finding Data

At this point you probably realize that data, or potential data is all around us. While some of us may only ever open and read spreadsheets, we interact with graph data constantly, whether using the library catalog or searching Facebook or using web-based maps. In our own research we are often faced with the task of creating our own datasets from an overwhelming amount of material and this can take significant time and effort. Luckily there are plenty of resources for finding pre-compiled datasets, or "raw" data. We'll look at this soon, but first, let's discuss in more detail what you can expect to find in a data file. 

## What's in a data file?

When we talk about data files we are generally talking about common formats for sharing datasets in which the data is encoded in text characters and written to the file. We are *not* talking about databases, which may very well store data files, but should not be considered their equivilant. As mentioned previously, most datasets that you encounter will come in two forms:

1. **Tabular data** is represented in terms of columns, rows, and cells. Rows represent observations or instances, which have values corresponding to column variables. Tabular data is typically seen in proprietary formats (Excel or GoogleSheets files) or in character delimited text files (CSV - comma separated values - or TSV - tab separated values)

2. **Graph data** is data that can be represented by nodes and edges, roughly speaking. Think of this in terms of [networks that spider out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opte_Project#/media/File:Internet_map_1024.jpg). A **directed graph** is data that can be represented by a tree or a hierarchy. This is most commonly seen in XML or JSON formats, although you should note that these formats can also represent tabular data.
